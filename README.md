# 🖨️ PushTerm

**PushTerm** is a retro-style terminal tool that lets you auto-modify G-code for the Bambu Lab X1 Carbon printer. Its special feature? It inserts custom push-off logic into the G-code so the printer’s toolhead can physically eject a finished print from the build plate after a cooldown delay — all without needing extra hardware like a Raspberry Pi.

## Installation

You can now install PushTerm directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install pushterm

## 🧪 How to Use

1. **Download or clone** this project folder.
2. Put your G-code file (e.g., `Ploter.gcode`) inside the `MyPrints` folder.
3. Double-click or run this from the terminal:

   ```
   python launcher.py
   ```

4. When the terminal opens, follow the steps:
   - Type: `cd MyPrints`
   - Then: `begin`
   - Enter your file name: `Ploter.gcode`
   - Set the delay like `m5` for 5 minutes or `s30` for 30 seconds
   - Confirm how many copies to eject

5. The modified file will be saved in the same folder as:

   ```
   Ploter_modified.gcode
   ```

## ⚙️ What It Does

- Finds the end of your G-code file
- Adds a delay after the print finishes (based on your input)
- Inserts a G-code movement command to push the print off the bed using the toolhead
- Ensures safe travel height to avoid nozzle damage

---

## ✅ Requirements

- Python 3.x installed
- No extra dependencies — just basic Python and a terminal

---

## 🚨 Notes

- Always test modified G-code carefully.
- Use a safe push-off height to avoid nozzle damage.
- Works best on flat, hard-surface plates (like cool PEI or textured beds).
- Designed for Bambu Lab X1 Carbon but can be adapted.

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Because it’s fun to make your printer kick your prints off the bed like a boss.
